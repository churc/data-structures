<H3> Reading photocell sensors using Arduino boards and sending to AWS </H3>
<H4> Photoresistors reading light on 2 window sills for 12 hours / Arduino / Johnny-Five / AWS RDS</H4>
<H5> Light readings are in GMT (UTC): 6.30am - 6.30p EST is 11.30 - 23.30 GMT</H5>
<H6>Arduino photocell sensor light readings (AWS RDS, sublime text, terminal. Query in node):
appLight.js / sublime text: inserts photocell sensor readings into AWS table, lightP. (window number, light reading, time).
queryLightAWS3.js / class 10: queries RDS db and returns query into server.js

The aim was to record light change over the course of the day on 2 windowsills to find the optimal light/placing for edible plants. The project was inspired by attempts to grow plants at home with a new building going up across the street blocking out direct sunlight for part of the day.<br>
Questions:
<ul>
   <li>what times of day do the plants get light?</li>
   <li>which windowsill is brighter / can both windowsills be used for growing plants?</li>
   <li>what is the highest reading?</li>
   <li>overall assessment of light during the day - is there enough light to grow edible plants indoors?</li>
 </ul>

<H6>Data collection: <br>
Data was collected from 2 windows during daylight hours (6.30am â€“ 6.30pm) over 3 days (to check weather differences across days) using two arduino breadboards and two photocell sensors. Data was streamed to AWS RDS for light reading and time of reading with a 20000 delay.<br>
The aim was to plot light against time of day for each window. <br>
Light levels were checked against readings and grouped into brightness in order to understand the data more quickly and to provide a color code for plotting. The idea was to plot 12 hour data on a circle to easily show the relation of light to time of day.<br>
Light level groupings:
<ul>
   <li>very bright: greater than 950</li>
   <li>bright: between 800 and 950</li>
   <li>light: between 650 and 800</li>
   <li>dim: between 500 and 650</li>
   <li>very dim: between 350 and 500</li>
   <li>dusk: between  200 and 350</li>
   <li>nearly dark: between 50 and 200</li>
   <li>night: less than 50</li>
 </ul>

<H6>Examples of SQL query on AWS database (see queryLightAWS3.js/class10 c9): <ul>
<li>This queries readings on Dec. 5th, from 6.30am - 6.30pm to get the highest reading for window 1:<br>
<i>var queryHght04 = "SELECT * FROM lightP AS hght1 WHERE dateCreated &gt;'2016-12-05 11:30:00' AND dateCreated &lt;'2016-12-05 23:30:00' AND windowNo ='1' ORDER BY reading DESC LIMIT 1;"; </i></li>
<li>This queries readings on Dec. 5th, from 6.30am - 6.30pm which are between 800 and 950 and assigns them as bright:<br>
<i>var queryBright = "SELECT windowNo, reading, EXTRACT(HOUR from dateCreated) as hr, EXTRACT(MINUTE from dateCreated) as min  FROM lightP AS bt WHERE dateCreated &gt;'2016-12-05 11:30:00' AND dateCreated &lt;'2016-12-05 23:30:00' AND reading &gt;800 AND reading &lt;950 ORDER BY dateCreated;"; </i></li>
<li>This queries readings on Dec. 7th, simplifies the date time stamp into hours and mins (UTC) and orders by reading:<br>
<i>var queryLong2 = "SELECT windowNo, reading, EXTRACT(HOUR from dateCreated) as hr, EXTRACT(MINUTE from dateCreated) as min FROM lightP AS long2 WHERE dateCreated &gt;'2016-12-07 11:30:00' AND dateCreated &lt;'2016-12-07 23:30:00' AND reading &lt;1100 ORDER BY reading;";</i>
</li>
<li>This queries readings on Dec. 5th, simplifies the date time stamp into hours and mins (UTC) and orders by time to find times when windowsills are getting good light:<br>
<i>var queryLong3 = "SELECT windowNo, reading, EXTRACT(HOUR from dateCreated) as hr, EXTRACT(MINUTE from dateCreated) as min FROM lightP AS long3 WHERE dateCreated &gt;'2016-12-05 11:30:00' AND dateCreated &lt;'2016-12-05 23:30:00' AND windowNo = '2' AND reading &gt;650 ORDER BY hr;";</i></li><br>
